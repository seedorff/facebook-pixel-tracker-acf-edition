NOTE: This plugin requires ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) to work.

A simple plugin for using the Facebook Tracking Pixel on your wordpress site.
The plugin allows you to set a global tracking code on all your pages. Other similar plugins often requires you to input the tracking script on each page and post.

As default the Facebook Pixel tracking script will be placed on every page with the page-view event.
On each page you have the option to disable tracking, as well as add other Facebook events. For instance Lead.

Installation is simple:
Upload or install this plugin.
Get ready your Facebook Pixel tracking ID, which you will find when you first setup your Facebook Pixel at Facebook.com
Then input your tracking ID in the Facebook Pixel settings page.
Adjust events for each page as you like.

Enjoy!
